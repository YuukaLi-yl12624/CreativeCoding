# Geometric Abstraction Assignment

I chose [Meridianos](https://g.co/arts/f4DyzGjF4T5uTYb26) for this assignment. 

I altered the color of the original work and made an abstract image of a sail boat in the sea, with a person standing in the front of it. 

The part that is different from the original is the sides of the back big sails (the blue ones) are supposed to be curves, but I could not figure out ways to make it work well, so I made them as staright lines.
