## Week 1 Reading Assignments

### Reading 1
> “The university is a gym for your mind. For both body and mind, your abilities and skills atrophy or decline when they’re not used, like a dead limb, for efficiency and energy-savings” (Lin).

I like this quote because it uses a good simile and straightforwardly warns the audience that if people do not do things by themselves, they can soon loose the capability to do things. *This is very alerting to me, and I believe that this quote will come back to my mind in the future when I think about using AI to do works for me.* 

### Reading 2
> “By   becoming mechanics and Luddites, we get to the heart of how these systems work,  who  they  work  for,  and  what  we  can  do  to  change  them. Together  these  models  provide  us  with  the  tools  necessary  for rejecting  the  systems  thrust  on  us  by  others  and,  in  their  place, making our own future” (Sadowski, 47).

I like this quote because it encourages the audience that even in today’s days, when the development of technology has been causing a wide range of anxiety of people’s jobs being taken away by AI, it is still possible for human to find their ways out and have a balanced relationship with technology. *I really enjoyed seeing the author’s understanding and analytics of human's relationship with technology using his own words and own perspective.* 

### Reading 3
> “As a result, instead of optimizing our machines for humanity—or even the benefit of some particular group—we are optimizing humans for machinery. And that’s why the choices we make (or don’t make) right now really do matter as much or more than they did for our ancestors contending with language, text, and printing” (Rushkoff, 15).

I like this quote because it points out a long-existing problem that many people has not yet noticed: things human made can gradually affect human themselves - just like how the Moon's gravity pulls the Earth's tide - and how technology has been affecting human can be potentially dangerous. *I like how the author relates the situation today to those in the past to predict the best future prospects of huma & technology.*
